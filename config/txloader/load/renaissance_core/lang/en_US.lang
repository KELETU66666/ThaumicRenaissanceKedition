chapter.lang.title.2=Primary Tasks
chapter.lang.desc.2=Following the traditional start of Minecraft, you’ll need to head underground to mine and gather resources. Here, you’ll need to collect redstone, gold, iron, and copper. If you happen to find diamonds, consider taking a trip to the Twilight Forest—it might make gathering resources even easier!

chapter.lang.title.3=Basic resource collection
chapter.lang.desc.3=Collect the resources you need... You only need to find 2-3 pieces of gold ore, some iron ore, and about 10 pieces of redstone to complete your basic mineral preparation for the vanilla game... Of course, you also need to collect the 6 colors of crystal fragments that naturally generate.

chapter.lang.title.4=Obtaining Crystal Shards
chapter.lang.desc.4=To begin your journey into Thaumcraft 6, you first need to collect the six different types of Mystical Crystal Shards. This is quite a task, but once you obtain just one of the crystal shards, the quest will reward you with all six types of shards, saving you from the tedious mining process of the original game and quickly immersing you in the mysteries of Thaumcraft!

chapter.lang.title.5=Development Path
chapter.lang.desc.5=After finding any crystal shard, throw it away and then pick it up again. You'll get a prompt saying you've pricked your finger. After that, sleep and follow the guidance of the strange dream to craft the Thaumaturge's Handbook!

chapter.lang.title.6=Basic Preparation
chapter.lang.desc.6=Once you have obtained the Magic Handbook, the next step is to craft the Arcane Workbench and Magical Lens.%n%nFirst, open the Magic Handbook and click on the flashing "Initial Exploration" research to unlock the crafting recipe for the Arcane Workbench.%n%nNext, right-click the World Salt on the crafting table, and it will transform into the Arcane Workbench. This workbench is used to craft basic items for Thaumcraft.%n%nThe Arcane Workbench has a 3x3 crafting grid with six additional slots on the sides, where you can place the corresponding color mana crystal shards. The number of crystal shards used for crafting depends on the recipe shown in the crafting table.%n%nAbove the result slot, you’ll see small blue text showing the mana in the surrounding area, which indicates how much Aura is available.%n%nAfter placing items in the crafting grid, if the conditions are met, the product will appear in the result slot. If there is a rotating circle around the item, it indicates that the corresponding element’s mana crystal shards will be consumed.%n%nThe blue text showing the total amount of Aura in the area will display a light blue number above it, which represents the amount of Vis used in the recipe.%n%nOne significant advantage of the Arcane Workbench is that any placed items will not return to your inventory if you exit the crafting interface.%n%nAfterward, open the Magic Handbook again and click "Complete Research" to finish the research on the Arcane Workbench and unlock the next research (Magical Lens).%n%nThen, use the 6-color mana crystals, 4 gold ingots, and 1 glass pane to craft the Magical Lens at the Arcane Workbench.%n%nOnce you have crafted the Magical Lens, right-click or sneak-right-click to scan blocks. While holding the Magical Lens, all unscanned blocks will be marked with small flashing light blue dots.%n%nYou can also hover the Magical Lens over an item to automatically scan it.%n%nScanning blocks will unlock research and provide you with knowledge of "Observation."%n%nThe more complex the scanned block, the more knowledge you will gain.%n%nSome research requires scanning specific items or acquiring the corresponding knowledge.

chapter.lang.title.7=Journey to the Nether
chapter.lang.desc.7=Sometimes, the Overworld won't meet your needs, and that's when you'll need to head to the Nether. The Nether contains many materials you'll need, such as magma blocks, lava, glowstone, quartz, and more...

chapter.lang.title.8=Aether and Thaumic Waves
chapter.lang.desc.8=To unlock Alchemy, the first step is to craft a Cauldron. Before using the Cauldron, we need to understand the concept of the Aether Field.%n%nIn TC6, the Aether system is different from the node-based system in TC4. The Aether in TC6 naturally fills every chunk, and your arcane activities are no longer limited by nodes. The unit of Aether is Vis, with a minimum precision of 0.1.%n%nVis is primarily used in casting spells and crafting. Many arcane recipes require Vis for crafting, and Vis will slowly regenerate under normal conditions. Unlike TC4’s wand Vis, which was divided into elemental types, TC6 Vis is unified, making the construction of magical crystal farms much easier. Each chunk has a unique Aether threshold, beyond which Aether can slowly spread to neighboring chunks.%n%nThe Aether threshold is the maximum amount of Aether that can naturally regenerate within a chunk. Each chunk has its own fixed threshold, and this cannot be altered. When you are in a Magical Forest biome, the Aether threshold is larger, meaning the area will have more abundant Aether and will regenerate faster.%n%nWhen holding the Thaumaturge Lens, you can observe the Aether levels in the chunk in the top-left corner of the interface. By sneaking, you can view the precise amount of Aether in the chunk.%n%nIf the remaining sources in the Cauldron are not processed in time or if they are improperly cleared, Thaumic Waves may occur.%n%nThaumic Waves are considered "polluted Aether." They affect the regeneration of Aether in the chunk, and if severe, they can create rifts. Rifts can destroy surrounding blocks (including chests, ME drives, etc.) and devour any dropped items. When Thaumic Waves occur, you can clearly see purple star-shaped clouds rising into the sky.%n%nAlthough direct contact with these clouds doesn’t have immediate effects, the presence of these clouds signifies that polluted Aether has already been released into the chunk’s Aether field. Thaumic Waves can also slowly spread to neighboring chunks, at a faster rate than normal Aether.%n%nThe maximum Thaumic Wave value in a chunk is 32,766. When holding the Thaumaturge Lens, you can see the Thaumic Wave amount as a deep purple bar on top of the light pink Aether bar.%n%nAbout Rifts: When the Thaumic Wave value of a chunk exceeds 75%% of the Aether threshold, a Thaumic Rift can spawn. Every additional 50 Thaumic Waves increases the chance of the Rift appearing by 1%%. Once a Rift enters a block, it will destroy it. If a mob approaches a Rift, it will continuously take 2 points of Void damage. There are many ways to destroy Thaumic Rifts, but currently, none are achievable, so in the early stages, you will have to wait for the Rift to naturally disappear after absorbing all the Thaumic Waves. However, when a Rift disappears naturally, it usually means that Corrupted Spores have spawned. These are the source of pollution, difficult to kill, and they spread corruption, so don’t let them appear in your base!%n%nYou can use Quartz Fragments to process excess sources in the Cauldron, so make sure you have plenty of Quartz. The small amount of Quartz available in the overworld will only help you make a few Quartz Fragments, so to create more, head to the Nether.%n%nFor more details, check out the relevant chapters

chapter.lang.title.9=Alchemy 2
chapter.lang.desc.9=You have now understood the concept of "Hex Waves," and it's time to use the Crucible!%n%nFirst, click the flashing research to unlock and view the recipe.%n%nNext, follow the recipe in the Thaumaturge's Handbook to create the Crucible by right-clicking a regular brewing stand with World Salt.%n%nUse a heat source (such as flames, lava blocks, or the Glowing Light) to heat the Crucible. Afterward, use a bucket to add water to the Crucible. Be aware that you cannot use a bucket to remove water from the Crucible. To empty the Crucible in advance, you can only do so by Shift+right-clicking.%n%nIn order to craft items, you need to unlock the corresponding research and have enough elements. Hold shift and move your mouse over an item to see which elements it contains. If no elements are shown, it means the item does not contain any.%n%nItems with elements thrown into the Crucible will dissolve and disperse their elements. When you have enough elements and the corresponding research unlocked, you can throw the item into the boiling water to craft the item.%n%nNote that the essence in the Crucible will decompose over time, producing purple smoke. This is the Hex Wave mentioned in the previous chapter. Each unit of element corresponds to a unit of Hex Wave. By Shift-right-clicking, you can empty the Crucible of all its elements at once, which has the same effect as directly breaking the Crucible or natural decomposition, both of which will generate Hex Waves. Therefore, it is essential to handle Crucibles with excess elements in a timely manner, using Quartz Shards to neutralize them

chapter.lang.title.10=Preparing for the Smeltery
chapter.lang.desc.10=Here's the translation adjusted to use the correct Thaumcraft 6 Aspects:%n%nPreparing to Create the Smeltery%n%nTo craft the Smeltery, you'll need to gather a significant amount of Quartz Shards. This task will guide you on which items are best suited for dissolving into the required Aspects.%n%nEssential Items for Dissolving:%nVacuos: The Throwing Device (Bowls are best, but the Throwing Device contains this Aspect).%npotentia: The Throwing Device (Coal and Redstone are best, but the Throwing Device contains this Aspect).%nLux: Torches.%nMotus: Boats.%nGelum: Snowballs.%nPermutatio: Dispenser.%nVitreus: Glass or Amber.%nMetallum: Cinnabar (Ore).%nVictus: Various Saplings.%nMortuus: Cinnabar (Ore).%nThese are just simple examples. In practice, you can adjust the items you dissolve based on your environment. In JEI (Just Enough Items), search for the corresponding Aspect names to view all items that contain that Aspect. Then, dissolve the items that suit your needs.%n%nImportant Notes:%n2 points of an Aspect are required to create 1 Quartz Shard. 1 point of an Aspect cannot be processed using Quartz Shards.%nWhen unlocking the Smeltery section, you will also receive the recipe for the Essence Smeltery and Essence Tank.%nWorking with the Smeltery:%nEssence Smeltery: Place the Essence Smeltery on the ground and place an Arcane Distiller above it.%nArcane Distiller: The Arcane Distiller can "export" Essence from the Smeltery, storing up to 128 points of Essence of a single type.%nThe Arcane Distiller can be stacked on top of other Distillers for additional storage, but it will not increase the distillation speed.%n%nWarning:%nWhen the Smeltery is in operation, some of the Essence will inevitably dissipate as Wisp Waves, so be sure to place the Smeltery far away from your base!

chapter.lang.title.11=Card Drawing System
chapter.lang.desc.11=Creating the Research Table:%nTo craft the Research Table, place a Pen and Ink on a Wooden Table (only one is required, they do not need to be adjacent).%n%nUsage Instructions:%n%nUpon first use, place Pen and Ink and the necessary materials in the upper-left corner of the interface. Also, place several Paper in the upper-right corner. Then, click the "Create Theory" button in the center of the interface to start the research.%n%nOnce the research starts, click the “?” on the left side to begin Card Drawing (each draw consumes one piece of paper). This will randomly generate two cards (if there are extra draws, three cards will appear). You can click the cards to choose the ones you want.%n%nThe light above the card shows how much Inspiration will be reduced by selecting that card. Cards with a plus symbol in front will increase Inspiration.%n%nThe bottom of the card shows the required items. These items must be placed in your inventory (§c§lor adjacent containers§r¹) to be selectable. Items marked with an exclamation mark will be consumed when you confirm your choice. Every time you confirm, the Pen and Ink’s durability will decrease.%n%nWhen you run out of Inspiration, click "Complete Theory" to gain Theory Research Progress. For subjects that are not at the highest progress, some research progress will be lost, but certain cards can increase the number of subjects that reward the full progress.%n%nYour initial Inspiration amount will increase as you unlock more "※" shaped research topics.%n%n(Usage instructions are sourced from https://www.mcmod.cn/item/77166.html)

chapter.lang.title.15=The Arcane Infusion Altar
chapter.lang.desc.15=Enchanting, while being a task on par with Thaumaturgy, requires the Thaumaturge's Gauntlets as a support.%nThe ancestral device needed for enchanting is the Enchanting Altar.%nIt requires eight Arcane Stone, one Arcane Base, one Rune Matrix, and one Salis Mundis. The building schematic can be found in the Enchanting section of the Arcane Enchantment chapter, under the "Bookmarks" on the right side of the book page.%nOnce the structure is built, sprinkle a handful of Salis Mundis on it, then right-click the Rune Matrix with the Thaumaturge's Gauntlets to complete the Enchanting Altar!%nThe Enchanting Altar requires Bases to be placed around it. It is recommended to make two pairs of symmetrically placed Enchanting Bases in the early stages. Be sure to place them symmetrically, or the stability of the Enchanting Altar will be reduced.

chapter.lang.title.16=Better Thaumaturge Armor

chapter.lang.title.35=Charging
chapter.lang.desc.35=The Charged Base is a useful device in Thaumic Renaissance for automatically charging items that use Vis for energy. To use it, right-click on the base to place the item you want to charge, and it will automatically draw Vis from the surrounding Aura in the chunk where it is located. This allows the item to be replenished with energy without needing manual intervention.%n%nWhile charging, if you're wearing the Revealing Goggles, you can hover your mouse over the charged item to see the current energy levels of the item. This provides an easy way to monitor the charging process and ensure your items are properly powered.%n%nHowever, one limitation of the Charged Base is that it does not support the Arcane Workbench Charger. This means that certain items, particularly those requiring a more specific type of energy transfer or more complex charging methods, cannot be charged via the Charged Base and may require an alternative method or structure.

chapter.lang.title.36=Storage Pouch
chapter.lang.desc.36=Spellcasting Core Pouch%nThe Spellcasting Core Pouch is an accessory that, although categorized as a belt, functions effectively when placed in the inventory, providing a significant advantage in managing spellcasting cores.

chapter.lang.desc.64=The Essence Mirror is an advanced device designed for cross-dimensional transport of Essence. It functions similarly to the Magic Mirror, allowing you to transport Essence between dimensions and locations, enhancing the efficiency of your resource management and magical operations.%n%nHow it Works:%nThe Essence Mirror operates by channeling Essence from one point to another, similar to the way the Magic Mirror facilitates item transport. However, the key difference is that it allows for the transport of Essence across different planes or dimensions.%n%nUsage:%nThe Essence Mirror functions by placing one in the source location (such as your base) and another in the target location (e.g., a different dimension or area). Once activated, Essence will flow from the source mirror to the target, efficiently transporting magical energy over vast distances.%n%nControls:%nAs with the Magic Mirror, the process of using the Essence Mirror is simple and intuitive. You can shift Essence from one mirror to another by interacting with the device and following the instructions provided in the Magic Mirror chapter for more details.%n%nImportant Warning:%nEssence Transport Cost:%nEvery time you transport 64 Essence via the Essence Mirror, 1 point of Warp will be generated. This means you need to be cautious when frequently using this device, as transporting large amounts of Essence can lead to an increase in Warp, which can cause negative effects on your character, such as strange events or physical and mental distortions.%nTips for Safe Usage:%n%nTo minimize the Warp accumulation, consider only transporting small amounts of Essence at a time.%nUse the Essence Mirror strategically and avoid overloading the system with large amounts of Essence, especially in the early stages of using the device.%nIn summary, the Essence Mirror is a powerful tool for cross-dimensional Essence transport, but it comes with the risk of increasing Warp. Use it wisely to enhance your magical operations while keeping an eye on the potential consequences!。

chapter.lang.title.97=Usage of Impetus Energy
chapter.lang.desc.97=Now that you’ve learned how to transport Impetus` Energy, you can start using it in various ways. Apart from directly affecting your Mage's Gauntlet, Impetus Energy has three primary uses: Charging, Power Generation, and Biome Conversion.%n%nCharging%nVoid Recharge Pedestal: This is used to charge items that require Impetus Energy. These include items like Impetus Conductors, Mage's Gauntlets with Cells, and certain devices that cannot directly extract energy from rifts. You can place these items next to the Pedestal to charge them with the stored Impetus Energy.%n%nBiome Conversion%nArcane Terraformer: This uses a massive amount of Impetus Energy. It's highly recommended to store energy in the Runic Matrix to handle this conversion. The energy needed for this process is substantial, so be sure to have enough stored before beginning the conversion. More details will be provided later on how to best use the Runic Matrix for this task.

chapter.lang.title.98=Deadly Weapon -- Impulse Cannon
chapter.lang.desc.98=Impulse Cannon must be charged on a Void Recharging Pedestal and cannot directly extract energy from rifts.%n%nOnce fully charged with energy, it will fire a powerful laser beam that deals 1 magical damage per frame to enemies, which is quite terrifying. Additionally, it can be upgraded with two different components:%n%nOrbital Cannon Module: When this upgrade is installed, the cannon's attack mode changes to firing an energy beam that instantly deals 30 damage. The beam has a range of 64 blocks and comes with a penetration effect, damaging enemies along a line. After firing, the cannon enters a 5-second cooldown period.%n%nBurst Mode Module: When this upgrade is installed, the cannon's attack mode changes to rapidly firing 3 energy beams, each dealing 8 damage. Due to slight recoil, each subsequent beam is fired slightly higher than the previous one. The beams have a range of 33 blocks, and after firing, there is a 1.5-second cooldown before it can fire again.%n%nAll components can be crafted on a workbench in combination with the cannon to upgrade it.

chapter.lang.title.99=Defeating the Primal Wisp
chapter.lang.desc.99=The Primal Wisp is an incredibly powerful entity, but no matter how strong it is, it’s still just a tough spirit. Using ranged weapons, you can easily deal with it. Once defeated, it will drop a Loot Bag and a Primal Dust. This battle is definitely worth the effort. It only consumes a single Arcane Infusion Canister, but in return, you’ll receive 1/8th or even 1/4th of a Primal Pearl.

chapter.lang.title.100=Rift Stability Detection
chapter.lang.desc.100=This device can detect the stability of a rift and remind you to avoid the rift being drained due to low energy or becoming too unstable and corrupting (Note: it is a reminder function; this device only has detection capabilities!). For detailed operation, refer to the Thaumaturge’s Manual.

chapter.lang.title.101=Localized Rift Generation – Dimensional Perforator
chapter.lang.desc.101=The Dimensional Perferator is a small item from the Thaumcraft, designed for pinpoint rift generation. Here's how to operate it:%n%nPlacement: Place two Dimensional Perferator facing each other, with a distance of 9 blocks apart. When positioned correctly, purple particles will flow between them, indicating they are aligned.%n%nSource Infusion: After placement, you can channel contaminated Vitium Essence into the devices. Both Perferators will consume 50 points of Vitium Essence simultaneously to initiate a rift activity, either to open or expand a Rift.%n%nRedstone Control: You can pause the rift creation process by applying a redstone signal to the Rippers. When a redstone signal is received, the rippers stop working but continue absorbing the Essence. Once more Essence is absorbed and the redstone signal is deactivated, a more powerful rift will form.%n%nWarning: If the rift grows too large, it might swallow the Dimensional Rippers, so proceed with caution!

chapter.lang.title.102=Arcane Terraforming
chapter.lang.desc.102=Arcane Biome Terraformer%n%nThe Arcane Terraformer is an advanced device that requires three types of energy to operate: Impetus Energy, Vis, and Essentia. Here's how to use it:%n%nStep-by-Step Usage:%nConfiguring the Biome Focus:%n%nTo begin, the Arcane Terraformer needs to collect the basic information about the current biome. You can do this by using an Empty Biome Focus to gather data about the surrounding biome.%nTo clear the current biome information and make the focus reusable, sneak-right-click with the Biome Focus.%nIf you want to reset a biome to its original state, you can create an Original Biome Focus by placing an Empty Biome Focus and a Primordial Pearl in a crafting table. This will not consume the Primordial Pearl.%n%nPlacing and Configuring the Terraformer:%n%nAfter creating and configuring the Biome Focus, place the Arcane Teraformer in the world and right-click to open its GUI.%nPlace the configured Biome Terraformer into the central slot of the GUI.%nOn the right side of the interface, you can adjust the mechanical range of the biome conversion (size and shape of the biome to be altered).%nOn the left side of the GUI, the required amount of Essentia for the transformation will be displayed.%nEnergy Requirements:%n%nEnsure the Arcane Terraformer has enough Vis, Essentia, and Impetus Energy. Aura can be drawn from the surrounding area, so equip an Vis Regenerator to generate continuous Vis for the device.%nThe device has only an input slot for Impetus Energy and no output slot. It may also require five types of Essentia: Ignis, Aqua, Terra, Aer, and Permutatio. The first four are basic elements necessary for biomes. For instance, a hot biome requires Ignis, while a wet biome needs Aqua, and so on. Every biome will need Permutatio, which is essential for all biomes.%nAs the area to be transformed increases, so does the required amount of resources.%nStarting the Conversion:%n%nOnce the required resources are in place, right-click the Arcane Biome Converter with your Mage’s Hand to begin the conversion process.%nTo cancel the conversion, right-click again with the Mage’s Hand, but the converted area will not revert.%nFor further info look in the Thaumonomicon

chapter.lang.title.103=Storing Void Energy
chapter.lang.desc.103=Impetus Energy is difficult to collect, but in most cases, some devices only require a small amount of Impetus Energy to operate for a long time. However, the Arcane Cluster Conversion Device is an exception; it needs a massive amount of Impetus Energy and other types of energy. Therefore, using the rift to slowly extract energy is not always the best method. We need to store the Impetus Energy.%n%nBuilding the Impetus Runic Matrix is not difficult; simply follow the instructions in the manual. However, the next steps are more complex.%n%nFirst, you need to right-click the Impetous Cells and load them into the four faces of the matrix's upper and lower bases, meaning you can install up to eight cells. Even with just one cell, the matrix will activate. Adding more cells increases the matrix's capacity to store more Impetus Energy and speeds up the process of storing and extracting it. To remove an Impetus Cell, simply right-click with no items in hand. Be careful, as any excess energy will disappear when you remove the cells, so make sure not to waste it.%n%nThe matrix must maintain stability. As Impetus Energy is stored in the structure, it will begin to gradually lose stability. The more energy stored, the greater the loss of stability. You can stabilize the matrix by symmetrically placing Stablizers. The detection range of the matrix is smaller compared to the Runic Altar, requiring only a 5x5 area. The stability calculations are similar to the Runic Altar's. If the matrix becomes unstable, it may release faint purple lightning arcs, eject Immpetus Cells from their bases, or have other negative effects. You can wear the Revealing Goggles to observe the matrix blocks in the center and track the stability gain or loss of the matrix.%n%nThe Impetus Runic Matrix has one input and one output slot. When binding with a Impetus Resonator, aim it at the central matrix block to bind it. The color of the matrix rune also indicates the amount of energy within the matrix: red represents no energy, yellow represents half full, and green means it is full. Additionally, you can place a redstone comparator next to any part of the Impetus Runic Matrix to output a redstone signal representing the energy storage inside.

chapter.lang.title.104=Advanced Alchemical Smelter
chapter.lang.desc.104=Advanced Alchemical Smelter is a multiblock essentia smelter in late-game, it can smelt essentia with redculous speed and without any pollution, but you need to feed it impuse energy, the multiblock structure can found in thaumonomicon.%n%n=================Alchemical Grate=================%nThe Alchemical Grate provides a clean way to add items into your Advanced Alchemical Furnace: A hopper-like Inventory instead of uncontrolled item spillage.%nPlace an Alchemical Grate in the center of your Advanced Alchemical Furnace and fill it with items you want to break down into aspects.

chapter.lang.title.105=Flux and Corruption
chapter.lang.desc.105=In Thaumcraft 6 (TC6), unlike in TC4, essentia in the Crucible does not break down into secondary elements over time. Instead, any unprocessed essentia in the Crucible will gradually vaporize into flux and release into the aura if left untreated for a period.%n%nFlux Characteristics%nFlux Spread%nFlux does not exist as a fluid (such as flux goo or flux gas). Instead, it directly disperses into the aura, slowing the regeneration of Vis in the surrounding environment.%n%nEffects on Aura%nExcessive flux in the aura significantly hampers the efficiency of magic by reducing the rate of Vis regeneration. The more flux present, the slower Vis will replenish.%n%nConsequences of Excess Flux%nA high concentration of flux will eventually lead to the formation of Flux Rifts and Corruption. These phenomena are detailed in the next section, where we will discuss how they can damage your world and thwart your progress.%n%nIn summary, leaving too much essentia in the Crucible unprocessed for long periods will cause flux to accumulate, negatively impacting the aura and potentially leading to dangerous consequences like rifts and corruption. Proper management of flux is essential to avoid these outcomes

chapter.lang.title.106=Clearing Corrupted Blocks - Primordial Crusher
chapter.lang.desc.106=The Primordial Crusher is a late-game mining tool that comes with the enchantments Blazing Heart and Destruction. It automatically restores durability over time, making it a convenient tool for prolonged use.%n%nIts most notable feature is its ability to quickly mine Corrupted Blocks and even destroy them in a wide area. This means that you can rapidly clear large numbers of Corrupted Blocks, significantly helping in combating the spread of corruption.%n%nHowever, it is important to note that although the Primordial Pestle automatically restores its durability, its durability cap is relatively low. Therefore, it's recommended to add a Durability enchantment to ensure it lasts longer during use.%n%nTo craft this item, you will need to unlock the research titled Primordial Pestle in the Forbidden Arts research branch

chapter.lang.title.107=Flux Rifts
chapter.lang.desc.107=Rift%nThe conditions for the generation of rifts have been mentioned earlier. Now, let's discuss the effects of rifts on the environment.%n%n1. Rift's Appearance Location%nRifts tend to appear at the highest block in the chunk. To prevent a rift from consuming important containers such as chests, furnaces, or ME drives, it is recommended to build a wall or barrier in the area where the rift might appear. This helps prevent the rift from directly interacting with these items, thus avoiding their destruction.%n%n2. Rift Stability%nRifts have a stability value. Typically, rifts maintain stability by absorbing the curse waves in the surrounding aura. When curse waves are minimal or completely absent, the rift becomes unstable. An unstable rift can apply a curse flow debuff to nearby players, creating a cloud of curse mist at the player's location and further increasing the instability of the rift. Once instability reaches a certain threshold, the rift will disappear.%n%nWhen a rift disappears, there are usually two outcomes:%n%nCollapse: This occurs naturally with a very low probability. Rifts that collapse will drop rewards such as Void Seeds and Primordial Pearls, which can be used to unlock Forbidden Magic. If the rift is destroyed by Paradox Matter, collapse is guaranteed.%n%nCorruption: This is the more common scenario. The rift will suddenly disappear, leaving behind a Corruption Spore Nest. This is a source of corruption and will slowly pollute the surrounding environment while applying a Corruption Poison debuff to nearby creatures. Corrupted creatures will lose their health and may transform into the corresponding corrupted variant, gaining increased health and becoming hostile to players.%n%n3. Threat of Corruption Spore Nests%nThe Corruption Spore Nest is a major threat that appears when a rift disappears. It slowly corrupts the surrounding area, poisoning nearby creatures with corruption. If not dealt with promptly, it can cause significant problems as corrupted creatures become hostile.%n%nDealing with Corruption Spore Nests:%nWhen a Corruption Spore Nest spawns near your base, it must be destroyed as soon as possible. In the early stages of the game, close-range combat is not recommended, as the nest spawns powerful corrupted creatures. Instead, use Mage Gauntlets or Bone Bows for ranged attacks. Once the Corruption Spore Nest is defeated, it will drop Corruption Fragments and, on rare occasions, Distorted Treasures, which can be used for further research and upgrades.%n%nSummary:%nRifts and their resulting Corruption Spore Nests are environmental hazards that pose a significant threat, especially near your base. Timely management and removal of rifts, as well as preventing the spread of corruption, are essential for protecting your world and resources.

chapter.lang.title.108=Spread of Corruption
chapter.lang.desc.108=In the previous chapter, we discussed the origins of corruption. Now, we will explain how corruption spreads.%n%nWhen curse waves cause corruption fissures to form, a Corruption Spore Nest is created. However, the spread capacity of a single Corruption Spore Nest is limited and cannot maintain corruption over long distances for extended periods. At this point, the corruption spores will begin to appear at the outer edges of the nest's influence, and these spores will also spread corruption. As the spores propagate, more Corruption Spores will emerge at the edges of their range, creating a vicious cycle!%n%nFurthermore, if corruption becomes too severe, even after you eliminate the Corruption Spore Nest and the Corruption Spores, new Corruption Spores may still regenerate! This means you must continuously monitor and clean the corruption, as it could reoccur if left unchecked.%n%nIf corruption spreads too deeply and the Corruption Spores reach underground caves, the situation becomes even more difficult. Corrupted blocks are extremely tough to mine, and early on, players don't have effective means to break them (corrupted blocks are highly resistant to explosions). This creates situations where the corruption cannot be completely cleared. In the early stages, if you cannot control the formation of corruption, make sure to keep it far from your base, as it can quickly escalate into an uncontrollable disaster!

chapter.lang.title.109=Flux and it's creation
chapter.lang.desc.109=The Creation of Flux Rifts%n%nWhen operating devices like your Crucible, Smeltery, and other production setups, every point of naturally released essentia contributes to the flux level of the Vis (corrupted aspects being particularly severe).%n%nWarp within the aura slows the aura’s natural regeneration rate and reduces its efficiency.%n%nIf the flux level exceeds 75%% of the aura’s Vis, a Flux Rift will form. These rifts will consume any blocks they come into contact with (e.g., chests, furnaces, ME drives) and destroy dropped items. Therefore, avoid their formation at all costs!%n%nWhen using the Crucible, make sure to use Quartz Shards to crystallize excess essentia. Each shard can crystallize two points of essentia, allowing you to control the release of flux more effectively.%n%nAdditionally, there are methods to reduce the flux level in the aura, which will be discussed later

chapter.lang.title.110=After the Corruption Fades
chapter.lang.desc.110=Transformations After Corruption Fades%n%nCorrupted Wood & Fountains:%n%nThe Corrupted Wood and Corruption Fountains will turn into Curse Slime when the corruption fades.%nThis Curse Slime will eventually transform into Mysterious Slimes, which can be a dangerous threat. Ensure to handle them with caution.%n%nCorrupted Dirt:%n%nCorrupted Dirt will revert back to Regular Dirt once the Corruption is cleared.%nHowever, for a more thematic touch, Secondary Corruption Dust could also be an interesting option to use instead of regular dirt.%n%nCorrupted Stone:%n%nCorrupted Stone will transform into Permeable Stone, a type of mineral block.%nDigging through Permeable Stone will yield various items such as Crystal Fragments, Ore Clusters, Gems, and Sea Crystal Sand.%nThere's also a chance to find Corruption Fragments, which have 100 points of Essence and can be used to craft the Distorted Pickaxe.%n%nImportant Notes:%n%nCorruption Slime: Be ready for the slimes that emerge after the corruption fades, as they can be aggressive and need to be dealt with quickly.%n%nResources: The transformation into Permeable Stone opens up opportunities to gather valuable resources, so make sure to mine those areas for useful drops.%n%nEssence Fragments: The Corruption Fragments can be an essential resource for advanced crafting, especially for tools like the Distorted Pickaxe.

chapter.lang.name.111=The Smeltery
chapter.lang.desc.111=Compared to the Crucible, the Smeltery generates a significant and unavoidable amount of flux, which can be challenging to manage without tools designed to clean up flux. Therefore, it is highly recommended to relocate your Smeltery away from your base unless you wish to risk its corruption.%n%nAdding auxiliary vents to your Smeltery can help neutralize some of the generated flux, but this is not a permanent solution. Even the most advanced Void Essentia Smeltery from Thaumcraft 6, equipped with three auxiliary vents, cannot achieve zero flux emissions. However, in this modpack, you can upgrade your Smeltery to a "Mithril" version, which prevents flux generation entirely. This upgrade is only accessible in the late game, by which time you should have the tools to handle flux effectively.%n%nIn summary, ensure your Smeltery is placed far away from your base during the early stages of the game.

chapter.lang.name.112=Efficient Flux Cleaning - Flux Scrubber
chapter.lang.desc.112=The Flux Scrubber is an advanced device capable of consuming Salis Mundus to rapidly clean flux from the aura at an impressive Aura-to-Flux ratio of 1:1.5. While it is highly efficient, its cost is substantial, and it draws heavily from the local aura. If the aura in the area is insufficient, this can result in the aura dropping to zero while some flux remains. This imbalance could trigger the premature appearance of a rift!%n%nTo craft the Flux Scrubber, you must unlock the "Flux Scrubber" research located in the Reflexology tab.

These elements help the condenser process and condense the Flux.%n%nSet Up a Pollution Source Container:%n%nBeneath the condenser, place a container that will store the Polluted Source Elements. The polluted elements will be transferred here once absorbed by the condenser.%n%nEfficiency of the Condenser:%n%nThe more Condenser Grids you install, the more efficient the condenser becomes. This means less non-corrupt source energy will be needed to clean more Flux.%nAs you improve the condenser's setup, it will clean Flux in a larger area, making it more effective for larger regions.%nMaintenance of the Flux Condenser%n%nGrid Clogging:%n%nGrids have a chance of clogging as they absorb Flux. When this happens, you will need to repair them.%nTo repair the clogged grids, Right-Click them with a Source Element Filter. This operation will consume the Source Element Filter, so be sure to stock up on them.%n%nAvoid Using Polluted Source Elements:%n%nDo not input Polluted Source Elements into the Flux Condenser, as this will immediately clog the grids. Make sure only non-corrupt source energy is used in the process.%n%nWarning:%nBe cautious and avoid using polluted energy in the system as it can cause the Flux Condenser to malfunction. Ensure you use only clean, non-corrupt source elements for optimal performance.

chapter.lang.name.114=Efficient Flux Cleanup - Flux Container
chapter.lang.desc.114=Flux Container is an efficient late-game tool for cleaning up flux. It works in tandem with the Flux Distiller. The Flux Container absorbs flux from the aura, much like an Aura Battery. The Flux Distiller then extracts the flux from the container and converts it into Tainted Essentia, making this method highly stable, though slightly less efficient%%nTo craft this item, you need to unlock the research "Flux Container" under the Thaumaturgy tab.

It is most effective for reducing Temporary Warp and can provide a buffer against more severe Warp Outbursts.%nNote: It is only effective in certain conditions and does not eliminate Permanent Warp.%nWarp Suppression Gear%n%nUsage: Certain pieces of armor and equipment provide a suppression effect against Warp. For example, the Warp Suppression Helmet can reduce the Warp accumulation rate, slowing down the increase in Warp value over time.%nTip: Look for equipment with the Warp Resistance enchantment to help mitigate the effects.%nWarp Healing Potions%n%nUsage: These potions temporarily reduce Warp or remove specific negative effects associated with high Warp values. They are a quick, but temporary, solution for managing the effects of Warp.%nMagical Rituals or Potions%n%nUsage: Some rituals or potions from the Forbidden Knowledge or Dark Arts research branches can be used to actively suppress Warp. These are more advanced and may have additional side effects, including increasing your Permanent Warp value.%nMagical Items and Artifacts%n%nUsage: Some rare magical artifacts provide long-term suppression of Warp effects. These items can be worn or equipped to continually reduce the adverse effects of Warp in your world.%nWarning%nWhile suppression can reduce the harmful effects of Warp, it is important to manage your Warp value actively. Prolonged exposure without proper suppression can result in uncontrollable Warp Outbursts, leading to dangerous consequences like Distorted Creatures or Corruption in the environment.%n%nIf left unchecked, Warp will eventually take a toll on your character’s mental state and the surrounding world, so suppression is essential, especially during early and mid-game progression

chapter.lang.name.118=Clearing Warp Effects
chapter.lang.desc.118=Rosehip Syrup%n%nUsage%nRemoves active Warp Reaction Debuffs, providing relief during critical situations.

chapter.lang.name.119=Pure Tears
chapter.lang.desc.119=Pure Tears can be used to remove up to 10 points of any type of distortion, following the removal order: temporary -> regular -> permanent.%n%nThis means that your temporary distortions must be completely removed before regular distortions can be cleared, and similarly, regular distortions must be cleared before permanent ones can be addressed.%n%nHowever, Pure Tears only become effective when your total distortion value exceeds 50 points.

chapter.lang.name.120=More Efficient Distortion Removal - Radiance of Purity
chapter.lang.desc.120=Using Sanitizing Soap to remove regular distortion is a tedious task, especially since both the Purifacation  soap and Water are quite expensive, making it difficult to mass-produce them.%n%nThis is where the Radiance of Purity comes in. It offers a stable way to remove regular distortion, but the trade-off is that you must charge it and wait for a period of time. During this waiting period, your body will continuously generate Flux Waves.%n%nOnce the charging is complete, it will remove 1–2 points of regular distortion. In the later stages of the game, this is a worthwhile investment.%n%nTo craft this item, you must unlock the hidden research Radiance of Purity under the "Arcane Enchantment" section, with its prerequisite being Primordial Pearl.

chapter.lang.name.121=Clear Warp
chapter.lang.desc.121=No matter how much you suppress the effects of the warp, there will always come a time when it cannot be maintained forever. Here, we will explain how to completely remove the warp.%n%nYou need to craft Exorcism Soap, which will allow you to clear all your temporary warp and part of your regular warp.%n%nTo remove temporary warp, it's simple: just keep rubbing the soap. However, to clear regular warp, you will need to combine it with Purification Bath Salt and Purification Water.%n%nWhen you have the Warp Protection Buff, using the soap gives you a chance to remove 0–1 point of regular warp. When you soak in Purification Water, using the Exorcism Soap will give you a higher chance of removing 1–2 points of regular warp. As for permanent warp, unfortunately, this soap is powerless against it.

chapter.lang.name.122=Types of Warp
chapter.lang.desc.122=Warp is categorized into three main types, each obtained through different means and with distinct characteristics. Here is a simplified explanation:%n%n§5Temporary Warp§r%nSources:%nEating Zombie Brains.%nConducting Eldritch research at the Research Table.%nUsing Eldritch Artifacts or Blood-related items.%nBeing observed by Eldritch Wardens or Eldritch Jailers through their Death Gaze.%nRemaining near a Rift during its collapse.%n%nBehavior:%nTemporary Warp is always reduced during Warp Events.%nIt can also be entirely removed using Purifying Soap.%n§5Standard (Sticky) Warp§r%nSources:%nConducting Eldritch research at the Research Table.%nUsing Eldritch Artifacts.%nCrafting items like the Brain in a Jar.%nStaying near a Rift during its collapse.%nBehavior:%nStandard Warp may occasionally decrease during Warp Events.%nUsing Purifying Soap under strict conditions can potentially reduce up to 2 points of Standard Warp.%n§5Permanent Warp§r%nSources:%nUnlocking Forbidden Knowledge (marked by a purple smoky aura in the Thaumonomicon).%nBehavior:%nPermanent Warp is irreversible and represents the deepest corruption of the soul.%nIt cannot be reduced by any normal means.%nIn this modpack, there is only one way to reduce Permanent Warp, but it is a late-game option.%n§5Equipment Warp§r%nDescription:%nEquipment Warp is technically a form of Permanent Warp that can be manually adjusted.%nIt is tied to the equipment or items you carry.%nBehavior:%nWarp from equipment is only active when the item is held or equipped.%nRemoving or unequipping the item will eliminate the associated Warp.%nWarp represents the consequences of delving too deeply into forbidden magic, with each type affecting gameplay differently.

chapter.lang.name.123=Warp and Its Effects
chapter.lang.desc.123=As you progress through your gameplay, you may occasionally hear an eerie sound, followed by the message: "§5Your body feels twisted§r" on your screen. This indicates that your "mind" has accumulated additional Warp.%n%nWarp is not a good thing—it frequently disrupts your gameplay by applying strange debuffs or hindering your focus. Below, we refer to these disruptive events as "Warp Surges."%n%nWarp Surge Effects%nWarp Surges vary based on your Warp value (temporary + regular + permanent). Most of the effects are negative, though a few beneficial ones may appear.%n%nCommon Warp Surge Effects:%nStrange Sounds and Feelings%n%nMessage: "What's that noise? Is something following you?"%nEffect: Applies Warp Flux for 250 seconds, with each 15 Warp points increasing its level (up to level 3).%nAdditional Message: "A strange fatigue washes over you."%nUnlocking New Research%n%nOne-time event: Unlocks Purifying Bath Salts research.%nMessage: "There must be a way to suppress these headaches!"%nHysterical Hunger%n%nEffect: Applies Warped Hunger for 250 seconds. Each 15 Warp points increase its level (up to level 3).%nMessage: "A sudden warped hunger makes you feel drained."%nHallucinations%n%nMessage: "Something seems to be following you..."%nEffect: Spawns a Warp Warden.%nAdditional Message: "A thick mist emerges, ghostly figures within."%nBlindness and Light Sensitivity%n%nEffect: Applies a highly nearsighted Vision Blur effect.%nDaylight Punishment: Applies Daylight Scorn for 250 seconds, causing damage in bright light. Each 15 Warp points increases its level (up to level 3).%nMessage: "Suddenly, the light becomes unbearable, burning your skin."%nWeakened Strength%n%nEffect: Applies Mining Fatigue for 60 seconds. Each 15 Warp points increases its level (up to level 3).%nMessage: "You suddenly tire of destruction."%nEnhanced Vision%n%nEffect: Grants Night Vision for 2 seconds per Warp point.%nMessage: "Your senses suddenly sharpen."%nHostile Creatures%n%nEffect: Spawns harmless Mental Spiderlings.%nMessage: "They're everywhere! Run!"%nWarning Sign%n%nMessage: "An unseen gaze watches you. Perhaps it's time to stop."%nBlood Portal%n%nEffect: Spawns a Small Blood Portal, summoning hostile creatures.%nMessage: "A faint chant echoes nearby."%n%nTypes of Warp:%n%n§5Temporary Warp§r%n%nGained through actions like consuming zombie brains, conducting Eldritch research, or using forbidden items (e.g., Blood Codex).%nAlways cleared during a Warp Surge or with Sanity Soap.%n%n§5Sticky Warp§r (Regular Warp)%n%nAccumulated through similar activities but persists longer than Temporary Warp.%nCan occasionally reduce during Warp Surges or with Sanity Soap under strict conditions (max reduction: 2 points).%n%n§5Permanent Warp§r%n%nA permanent, soul-deep corruption.%nGained by unlocking forbidden knowledge (research with a purple mist effect).%nCannot be removed except through highly advanced, late-game methods.%n%n§5Equipment Warp§r%n%nA unique, removable form of Warp.%nActive only when holding or wearing items or armor imbued with Warp.%n%nManaging Warp:%n%nSanity Soap: Effective at reducing Temporary Warp and occasionally Sticky Warp.%n%nPurifying Bath Salts: Unlockable research to suppress minor Warp effects.%nCareful planning is key to managing Warp, especially when permanent Warp begins to accumulate. Delving into forbidden knowledge always comes with a price.

chapter.lang.name.124=Filthy Tears
chapter.lang.desc.124=Impure Tears can remove 5 points of any type of distortion. The order of removal is: temporary → regular → permanent. This means that only once your temporary distortion is completely cleared, you can start clearing regular distortion, and the same goes for permanent distortion.%n%nHowever... it will only be effective if your total distortion value is above 50 points.

chapter.lang.name.125=Corrupted Plums
chapter.lang.desc.125=Primary Use%nActually... they don’t serve much of a purpose—unless you’re actively hoping to summon an army of Wither skeletons to spawn relentlessly behind you.%n%nAdditional Notes%nWhile technically edible, the plums are more of a liability than a resource due to their extreme side effects.%nIf you're looking for chaos or a challenging experience, keeping Corrupted Plums in your inventory might just provide it.%nIn short, these fruits are best avoided unless you’re feeling particularly masochistic or experimenting with Warp effects.

chapter.lang.name.126=Arcane Litmus Paper
chapter.lang.desc.126=Unlike the Sanity Checker, the Arcane Litmus Paper offers a precise measurement of your personal Warp values.%n%nKey Features%nPrecisely detects your Temporary Warp, Regular Warp, and Permanent Warp levels.%nSimple to use: Hold it in your hand and right-click to get an accurate reading of your current Warp state.%nImportant Note%nIf your Warp levels are too high, the litmus paper will be consumed after use, making it a single-use item in such cases.%nUtility%nThe Arcane Litmus Paper is an excellent tool for thaumaturges who want to monitor their mental state during dangerous research or experimentation with forbidden knowledge. Always have a few on hand to stay informed about your growing Warp levels!

chapter.lang.name.127=Demonic Whispers
chapter.lang.desc.127=Whisperweed can slowly increase your research progress but comes with the risk of occasionally giving you temporary Warp!%n%nIf you haven’t progressed in Botania, you can safely skip this section, as this flower consumes Mana to function.%n%nFor those using Botania, Whisperweed might be a valuable addition to your magical arsenal, but be mindful of its side effects. Ensure you have sufficient Warp management measures in place, such as Purity Talismans or Sanity Baths, to counteract the temporary Warp it may cause.

chapter.lang.name.128=Quick Research Acquisition: Using Curios
chapter.lang.desc.128=Using Curios to Accelerate Research%n%nUtilizing curios can significantly speed up your research process, with different curios enhancing specific research specialties:%n%nArcane Curio: Boosts Thaumaturgy. Obtainable by mining Sinister Crystals.%nBasics Curio: Enhances Alchemy. Found by mining Amber Ore.%nWarped Curio: Focuses on Infusion. Dropped by killing Corrupted Creatures.%nAncient Curio: Specializes in Golemancy. Occasionally spawns on loot pedestals in Eldritch Spires.%nLuminous Curio: Improves Arcane Infusion. Acquired through trades with Stoneborn.%nOccult Curio: Advances Occultism but adds Warp. Dropped by defeating Occult Guardians.%nPech Wand: Neutral, no specialization. Available through trades with Pech Mages.%nBloody Codex: Advances Occultism but adds Warp. Obtained from defeating Blood Cultists.%nAdditionally, using enchanted tools or weapons with the §6Curious§r enchantment grants a chance to acquire random curios when mining blocks or defeating mobs.
