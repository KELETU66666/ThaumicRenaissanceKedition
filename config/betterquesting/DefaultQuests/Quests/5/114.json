Ensure to handle them with caution.\n\nCorrupted Dirt:\n\nCorrupted Dirt will revert back to Regular Dirt once the Corruption is cleared.\nHowever, for a more thematic touch, Secondary Corruption Dust could also be an interesting option to use instead of regular dirt.\n\nCorrupted Stone:\n\nCorrupted Stone will transform into Permeable Stone, a type of mineral block.\nDigging through Permeable Stone will yield various items such as Crystal Fragments, Ore Clusters, Gems, and Sea Crystal Sand.\nThere\u0027s also a chance to find Corruption Fragments, which have 100 points of Essence and can be used to craft the Distorted Pickaxe.\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nCorruption Slime: Be ready for the slimes that emerge after the corruption fades, as they can be aggressive and need to be dealt with quickly.\n\nResources: The transformation into Permeable Stone opens up opportunities to gather valuable resources, so make sure to mine those areas for useful drops.\n\nEssence Fragments: The Corruption Fragments can be an essential resource for advanced crafting, especially for tools like the Distorted Pickaxe.",
