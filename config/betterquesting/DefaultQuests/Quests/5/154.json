      "desc:8": "Using Sanitizing Soap to remove regular distortion is a tedious task, especially since both the Purifacation  soap and Water are quite expensive, making it difficult to mass-produce them.\n\nThis is where the Radiance of Purity comes in. It offers a stable way to remove regular distortion, but the trade-off is that you must charge it and wait for a period of time. During this waiting period, your body will continuously generate Flux Waves.\n\nOnce the charging is complete, it will remove 1â€“2 points of regular distortion. In the later stages of the game, this is a worthwhile investment.\n\nTo craft this item, you must unlock the hidden research Radiance of Purity under the \"Arcane Enchantment\" section, with its prerequisite being Primordial Pearl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
