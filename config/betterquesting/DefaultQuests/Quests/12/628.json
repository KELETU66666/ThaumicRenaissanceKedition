      "desc:8": "Harnessing Impetus Energy\n\nOnce you\u0027ve obtained the Impetus Resonator, you can freely manipulate Impetus Energy for your devices and constructs.\n\nStep 1: Creating an Impetus Drainer\nThe Impetus Extractor is essential for drawing energy directly from rifts and channeling it into devices.\n\nUsage:\nPlace the Drainer near a rift.\nUse the Impetus Resonator to right-click the extractor and then right-click the target device that requires energy.\n\n\nStep 2: Building an Impetus Diffuser\nThe Impetus Diffuser simplifies energy distribution by dispersing energy to nearby devices that need it.\n\nBenefits:\nAvoids the need for multiple extractors.\nEfficiently manages energy flow within a localized area.\n\n\nStep 3: Using the Impetus Relay\nThe Impetus Relay functions similarly to the Mana Relay from Thaumcraft 4. It acts as a bridge when devices and extractors are too far apart.\n\nAdvantages:\nCost-effective solution for long-distance energy transfer.\nEasily integrated into complex setups.\n\nMaster these tools to unlock the full potential of your Thaumaturgical research!",
