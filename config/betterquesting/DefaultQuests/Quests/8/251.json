      "desc:8": "Magic Hand Mirror\n\nThe Magic Hand Mirror functions similarly to the Magic Mirror, but is much more portable. When used, right-clicking a hand mirror that is already linked to a target Magic Mirror will open an interface. Items placed into the interface will be transferred to the target Magic Mirror.\n\nThe Magic Hand Mirror is bound by right-clicking it on a Magic Mirror (once bound, the hand mirror will emit a subtle glowing effect, like an enchanted item). To bind it to a new Magic Mirror, right-click it again. One Magic Mirror can be bound to multiple Magic Hand Mirrors. If the Magic Mirrorâ€™s position changes, the Magic Hand Mirror will need to be re-bound.\n\nNote: The Magic Hand Mirror can only transmit items, not receive them.\n\n",
