      "desc:8": "Aberrant Pickaxe: A Tool That Defies Convention\nThe Aberrant Pickaxe operates in a way that challenges traditional expectations:\n\nPerformance:\n\nThe harder the material (e.g., obsidian), the faster it mines.\nSofter materials (e.g., stone) are mined very slowly, while some easy-to-break blocks (like grass) cannot be mined at all.\nBedrock: As for breaking bedrock... better not get your hopes up!\nCrafting Requirement:\n\nRequires a 100-Essentia Crystal Shard, which is obtained by mining Permeable Stone.\nPermeable Stone is created when Corrupted Stone undergoes purification.\nThis pickaxe is a paradoxical marvel, tailored for unique circumstances and designed for thaumaturges ready to embrace its eccentricities.",
