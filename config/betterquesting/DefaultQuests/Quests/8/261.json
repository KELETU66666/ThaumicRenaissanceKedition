      "desc:8": "The Arcane Bathhouse is a convenient, compact machine designed for magical relaxation and purification.\n\nPrimary Function: It automatically mixes water with Purifying Bath Salts to create Purified Water and pumps the mixture to the area directly above the machine. The pumped liquid can fill a 5x5 area, offering a wide zone of purifying coverage.\n\nVersatility: In addition to Purified Water, the machine can pump and distribute any liquid. Liquids can be added either by connecting automated systems or by manually right-clicking the machine with an appropriate liquid container.\n\nRedstone Control: A redstone signal can be applied to the machine to stop its operation, giving you full control over its activity.\n\nThe Arcane Bathhouse is a valuable addition to any thaumaturge\u0027s arsenal, especially for mitigating the effects of Warp and maintaining mental clarity during intensive research!",
