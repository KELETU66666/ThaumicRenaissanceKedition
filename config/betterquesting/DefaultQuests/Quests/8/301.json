This dimension is extremely dark, so make sure to prepare Night Vision Potions and Torches to help you navigate.\n\nImportant Preparations:\nNight Vision Potions:\nThe Outer Realm is very dim, and it\u0027s easy to get lost without proper lighting. Carry plenty of Night Vision Potions to make it easier to see in the dark.\n\nTorches:\nAs a backup, bring Torches to light your surroundings. While Night Vision is great, torches will help you mark your path and keep some areas well-lit.\n\nWatch for the Void:\nThe Outer Realm has dangerous voids scattered throughout. Be careful not to fall into these abysses as it can be deadly. Stay aware of where you\u0027re walking.\n\nWarning:\n§e§c§b§c§9§8§7§5§1§0§2§5§7§9§b§k Be cautious not to fall into the void of the Outer Realm. It can be lethal if you\u0027re not careful.",
